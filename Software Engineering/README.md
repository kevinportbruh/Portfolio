# Advanced Assginment Reminder App (Final Project)
This program was a solo semester long project for my Software Engineering class.
This was my first attempt at making a GUI with UX in mind, I am very proud of the way this program turned out.

The prompt we were given was simply to 'make something', So I began to think of something useful to make. 
I then decided to work on an assignment reminder app; the app will let the user upload their school E calendar in the form of a .ics file and allow the user to select specific events that they would like to be reminded of before the assignment is due.

The program uses Java to implement the backend logic. I wrote all the code for this program with Software Design Principles in mind. It uses the Ical4 API to parse .ics files. I then used Scenebuilder to create the GUI layout. This is done with JavaFX and produces JavaFX FXML files, Scenebuilder then provides skeleton class files which allow for simple implementaion of button logic/event handling. I also used Junit & Mockito for system testing. 

The application was designed for the assignment notification system at Appalaichain state university. It is fully functional and can be toyed with by using the provided test .ics file.
(This was a very fun project that I used to test my limits, please feel free to check out more indepth information about this one in the README)
